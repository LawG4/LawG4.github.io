My name is Lawrence; I have a master's degree in mathematics. My degree specialises in pure mathematics, primarily algebra and topology. I work as a Devtech engineer trying to grapple with and learn Vulkan and other GPU technologies. The blog aims to complete four main objectives:
+ Show off some of my best work in a portfolio
+ Build a platform for writing informative and useful articles
+ Write a Vulkan tutorial with my perspective as a beginner
+ Give myself a productive outlet.

This blog is still in its infancy, and I hope you can forgive any teething problems. Any feedback is always massively appreciated, and you can reach me on my Twitter linked in the sidebar. 

### A Personal Side Note

Being an ***autistic adult*** is an important part of my identity, it defines my daily struggles and my hyper fixations that allows me to lock into my work. I feel like it would be disingenuous to leave it out of my blog, but it doesn't suit the theme of this blog, so this footnote is my solution. Although I am lucky enough to be capable to work a full time job, I do still consider myself and other autistics to be *disabled.* I am still functionally limited, but through absurd luck, my special interest is easy to monetize, and with the support of fantastic collages I am able to be productive and get by. 

However, quite a few autistic adults are not as lucky as myself; ***80+% of all autistics have trouble securing long term employment.*** This is a terrifying statistic, that 80% of people with the same disability as myself struggle with finding work. Thinking back on my experiences, it started to make a lot more sense. Every single retail job I have ever worked has lead to daily meltdowns and significant negative impacts on my mental health. And despite still having continuous mental health struggles, my current industry is manageable, and I can even take reasonable care of myself.

I am personally extremely lucky, but I shouldn't be a lucky case. All autistic individuals should have access to consistent work or support, and that might require some employers to make certain accommodation adjustments in the future. Each and every autistic person is effected differently, and if there is one thing I ask of you, ***please listen to us.*** A lot of people use our disability to dismiss our agency, or simply don't understand that we have individual needs. Don't listen to organisations who claim to speak for us, or terrible movies *(looking at you Sia)*. Please ask the individual, respect our agency, and trust us to know our needs, and understand that they are needs.

I know that this has been extraordinarily preachy, and I understand that with the number of social issues that exist, it can be hard to care about a lot of them. I debated including the personal details, but I believe it is important to put on show the negative aspects, in order to make them seen. I hope you can still enjoy my blog.



All the best,  
Lawrence.
