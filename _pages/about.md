My name is Lawrence; I have a master's degree in mathematics. My degree specialises in pure mathematics, primarily algebra and topology. I work as a Devtech engineer trying to grapple with and learn Vulkan and other GPU technologies. The blog aims to complete four  main objectives:
+ Show off some of my best work in a portfolio
+ Build a platform for writing informative and useful articles
+ Write a Vulkan tutorial with my perspective as a beginner
+ Give myself a productive outlet to talk about my experiences as an autistic adult.

This blog is still in its infancy, and I hope you can forgive any teething problems. any feedback is always massively appreciated, and you can  reach me on my Twitter linked in the sidebar
